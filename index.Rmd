# Prerequisites {#prereq -}

Lessons presented here are a continuation of the [Geospatial workshop using R of Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#geospatial-data-workshop) described more specifically for the [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab: Sep 27-28, 2017](https://jsta.github.io/2017-09-27-LBNL/).

This content is setup for now using [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown) (using the [bookdown-demo](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo)) for expediency, and meant to eventually be folded into the [Software Carpentry style](https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles).
