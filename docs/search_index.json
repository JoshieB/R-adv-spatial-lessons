This content is setup for now using bookdown (using the bookdown-demo) for expediency, and meant to eventually be folded into the Software Carpentry style. "],

Objectives - Understand how to use the “then” operator %&gt;% to pass output from one function into input of the next. - Perform 1.2 Things You’ll Need to Complete this Tutorial R Skill Level: Intermediate - you’ve got basics of R down. You’ll need … 1.3 Challenge: Explore Raster Metadata Without using the raster function to read the file into R, determine the following about the NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_DSMhill.tif file: Does this file has the same CRS as DSM_HARV? What is the NoDataValue? What is resolution of the raster data? How large would a 5x5 pixel area would be on the Earth’s surface? Is the file a multi- or single-band raster? Notice: this file is a hillshade. We will learn about hillshades in Work with Multi-band Rasters: Images in R. 1.3.1 Answers rows 1367 columns 1697 bands 1 lower left origin.x 731453 lower left origin.y 4712471 res.x 1 res.y 1 ysign -1 oblique.x 0 oblique.y 0 driver GTiff projection +proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs file data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_DSMhill.tif apparent band summary: GDType hasNoDataValue NoDataValue blockSize1 blockSize2 1 Float64 TRUE -9999 1 1697 apparent band statistics: Bmin Bmax Bmean Bsd 1 -0.7136298 0.9999997 0.3125525 0.4812939 Metadata: AREA_OR_POINT=Area If this file has the same CRS as DSM_HARV? Yes: UTM Zone 18, WGS84, meters. What format NoDataValues take? -9999 The resolution of the raster data? 1x1 How large a 5x5 pixel area would be? 5mx5m How? We are given resolution of 1x1 and units in meters, therefore resolution of 5x5 means 5x5m. Is the file a multi- or single-band raster? Single. 1.4 Key Points The Coordinate Reference System or CRS tells R where the raster is located in geographic space and what method should be used to “flatten” or project the raster. "],
